            <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 cup half and half</li>
            <li> 2 cups shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried dill</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Toppings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped tomato</li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons chopped red onion</li>
                <li>1 jalapeno, sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> <pre>Place beer, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, and garlic 
in a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze in lime juice. Add steak, coat with 
marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the 
refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight.</pre></li>

            <li><pre>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread fries onto 
a baking sheet and spray with cooking spray. </pre></li>

            <li><pre>Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, 25 to 30 minutes, 
or per package instructions.</pre></li>

             <li><pre> Meanwhile, make cheese sauce. Melt butter in a saucepan over
medium heat; whisk in flour; whisk continuously until mixture turns 
golden and forms a smooth paste. Pour in half and half and stir until
mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted, 2 to 3 
minutes more. Stir garlic powder, oregano, and dill into the sauce.

             </pre></li>

             <li><pre>Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and 
lightly oil the grate. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off
excess. Discard remaining marinade. Cook steak on the preheated until
firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per 
side for medium rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove from the grill 
and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. </pre></li>
